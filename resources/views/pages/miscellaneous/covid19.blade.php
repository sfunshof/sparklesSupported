                        At Sparkles Healthcare we are up to date with all the 
                        developments relating to the continued spread of 
                        Coronavirus (COVID – 19) across the UK.

                    <p>
                        We understand that staff, Service Users and their families 
                        will understandably feel concerned about the risks posed by 
                        accepting Service Users from hospital or from within the community 
                        who either have symptoms, have no symptoms and have not been tested 
                        or who have had COVID-19 and are no longer symptomatic.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sparkles Healthcare recognises, however, that there is an obligation to protect
                        the NHS for the most critically ill and will ensure that 
                        robust risk assessments with stringent infection control
                        and personal protective equipment procedures are in place
                        to ensure that we can support the national effort to 
                        manage the COVID-19 pandemic

                        have procedures in place to protect staff who themselves are 
                        vulnerable to COVID-19 or who are shielding family members. <br>
                        Furthermore, We  will ensure that, through careful planning and 
                        robust precautions, the wellbeing and safety of our service users at

                        Our Management team will closely follow updated guidance 
                        directly from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus"> GOV.UK </a> ,

                        Staff will be updated through regular briefings from management
                         in changes to practice as provided by GOV.UK or the NHS

                    <P>
                        Training will emphasise that staff will only work within the realm of 
                        their competence at all times, in accordance with their codes of conduct.
                         Where upskilling of staff is necessary due to the impact of COVID-19 on 
                         staff supply, this will be provided using a Training Needs Analysis 
                         approach

                    <P>
                        We will ensure that staff regularly log into the Quality Compliance 
                        System to make sure they are reading the most up-to-date 
                        advice

                    <p>
                        Where Service Users require additional support due to the long-term 
                        effects of COVID-19, this will be documented in the Service User's 
                        Care Plan and staff will be supported and trained to carry this 
                        out

                    <p>
                        The important thing is to follow the Government’s instructions 
                        around social distancing as this will provide a safer environment 
                        for our Care worker to travel to and from our Service users' homes.

                    <p>
                        As with any virus, the most effective way to prevent infection 
                        and spread is to avoid being exposed to it. <br>
                         You can do your bit to prevent the spread of COVID -19 outbreak by 
                         doing the following: 
                         <ul>
                            <li>
                                Wash your hands often with soap and water for at 
                                least 20 seconds.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Always wash your hands when you get home or 
                                into work
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not
                                 available
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw 
                                the tissue in the bin straight away, or sneeze into the
                                 bend of your elbow, then wash your hands
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Avoid close contact with persons who have respiratory 
                                illness symptoms
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with 
                                unwashed hands
                            </li>

                                Make space by staying at least 2 metres apart – or 1 
                                metre with a face covering or other precautions
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you have coronavirus symptoms, stay at home (unless 
                                you are attending a test site) and book a free NHS test 
                                to check if you have coronavirus. <br>
                                 In the Republic of Ireland you should phone your GP or 
                                 GP out-of-hours straightaway to discuss your symptoms and 
                                 whether you need a test for COVID-19.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you are asked to self-isolate please follow the advice from 
                                the test and trace service in your area / nation. <br>
                                In some nations it is an offence not to self-isolate if 
                                told to do so
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                If a member of staff has a positive confirmed diagnosis of 
                                coronavirus Sparkles Healthcare will prepare a list of all customers and staff the
